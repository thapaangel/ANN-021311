##  About

This project implements a **simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using the **Perceptron learning algorithm** from scratch in **Python**, relying only on **NumPy**.  
It is designed for **educational purposes** to demonstrate the internal working of a **binary classifier** using a **step (threshold) activation function**.

##  Algorithm Overview

The Perceptron learns by adjusting weights based on the prediction error using the formula:
